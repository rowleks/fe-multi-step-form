## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learnt how to properly use useState hook to store the form states so it can persist across renders

I also learnt how to use the @use method of importing SCSS modules.

I further strenghtened my understanding of react and how to properly structure my project folders


### Continued development

I want to continue practicing to improve my skills in React and also learn NextJS to build robust and full-stack applications.


### Useful resources

- [React useStateHook Typescript](https://codedamn.com/news/reactjs/usestate-hook-typescript) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how useState hooks work in react and how to set types in the useState using generic types in typescript.
